#summary How do I use this code?


= Google Docs Setup =

I suggest you use Netbeans with the [http://portalpack.netbeans.org/ Portal Pack]. That's what I used to develop it.

You'll need the following libraries to build it:

 * portlet-api-1.0 (Portal Pack)
 * portlettaglib (Portal Pack)
 * GData-Docs-2.0
 * GData-Docs-Meta-2.0
 * Rome-1.0
 * jdom
 * gdata-core-1.0
 * gdata-client-1.0
 * gdata-client-meta-1.0
 * liferay portal-kernel
 * liferay portal-service
 * liferay util-java

Go [http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html#new register with google] and setup your certificate then import into your keystore using keytool.

Checkout the project, edit the keytool.java to match your keytool location and password.

Make whatever other modifications may be necessary. (The current code is built for liferay 5.1.2)

Build and Deploy!
